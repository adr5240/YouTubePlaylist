A short project built using AngularJS. To view, the user must install Node.js, NPM, and http-server.

To check if this is has been done, type into terminal:
`node -v`
`npm -v`

You should see numbers in the format
`v6.x.x` for Node
`3.xx.x` for NPM

Once you know that Node.js and NPM are installed, install http-server by typing into terminal:
`npm install http-server -g`

Download the project or clone the repository. Then navigate to the folders location within terminal. Once inside the YoutubeApp folder, type into terminal:
`http-server -o`
